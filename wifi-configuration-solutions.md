# WiFi Configuration Solutions for Lampy ESP32-C3

## Current Issue
The WiFi credentials (SSID and password) are hardcoded in the Arduino sketch at lines 25-26:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "@manjusstudio";
const char* password = "wifi2020!";
```

This requires recompiling and uploading new code every time the device moves to a different WiFi network.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. WiFi Manager Library (Recommended)
**Description**: Use the WiFiManager library which creates a temporary access point for initial setup.

**How it works**:
- On first boot or when WiFi credentials are invalid, the ESP32 creates its own WiFi hotspot
- User connects to this hotspot (e.g., "Lampy-Setup")
- Opens a web browser to configure WiFi credentials through a captive portal
- Credentials are saved to EEPROM/Preferences for future use

**Pros**:
- User-friendly web interface
- No need for serial console or app
- Handles credential validation automatically
- Mature, well-tested library
- Works on any device with WiFi browser

**Cons**:
- Requires initial setup step
- Slightly increases code complexity
- Small additional memory usage

**Implementation effort**: Medium (library integration)

### 2. Web-based Configuration Portal
**Description**: Create a custom web interface that runs when WiFi is not connected.

**How it works**:
- Device creates its own access point when no WiFi is configured
- Serves a custom configuration page
- User enters WiFi credentials through the web form
- Credentials saved to SPIFFS or Preferences

**Pros**:
- Full control over UI/UX
- Can integrate with existing web interface
- Can include additional configuration options
- Matches current code architecture

**Cons**:
- More development work required
- Need to handle edge cases manually
- Requires careful security implementation

**Implementation effort**: High (custom development)

### 3. Bluetooth Configuration
**Description**: Use Bluetooth for initial WiFi setup via a mobile app or web interface.

**How it works**:
- Device advertises Bluetooth service
- Mobile app or web Bluetooth API connects
- WiFi credentials sent over Bluetooth
- Stored in Preferences for future use

**Pros**:
- Modern approach
- Can create custom mobile app
- Secure pairing possible
- Good for IoT devices

**Cons**:
- Requires Bluetooth-enabled device
- More complex development
- ESP32-C3 Bluetooth support considerations
- User needs compatible device/browser

**Implementation effort**: High (Bluetooth stack + app)

### 4. Serial Configuration Menu
**Description**: Configure WiFi through Serial Monitor with menu system.

**How it works**:
- Device boots into config mode when no WiFi is set
- Presents menu via Serial Monitor
- User enters credentials through serial interface
- Saved to Preferences for future use

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- No additional hardware needed
- Direct debugging capability
- Quick for development/testing

**Cons**:
- Requires USB connection and Arduino IDE
- Not user-friendly for end users
- Not practical for deployed devices
- Technical knowledge required

**Implementation effort**: Low (simple serial input)

### 5. SmartConfig / ESP-Touch
**Description**: Use Espressif's SmartConfig protocol for WiFi provisioning.

**How it works**:
- Device enters SmartConfig mode
- User uses Espressif's app to broadcast credentials
- Device receives credentials from app
- Automatically connects to WiFi

**Pros**:
- Official Espressif solution
- Established protocol
- Works with official apps
- No access point needed

**Cons**:
- Requires specific mobile app
- Less flexible than custom solutions
- Protocol can be finicky
- Limited customization

**Implementation effort**: Medium (library integration)

### 6. WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)
**Description**: Use WPS button/PIN method for network connection.

**How it works**:
- User presses WPS button on router
- Activates WPS mode on ESP32
- Automatic credential exchange
- Connection established

**Pros**:
- Very simple user experience
- No manual credential entry
- Standard protocol

**Cons**:
- Requires WPS-enabled router
- WPS has known security vulnerabilities
- Not all networks support WPS
- Limited control over process

**Implementation effort**: Low (built-in ESP32 support)

## Recommended Approach

**Primary Recommendation: WiFi Manager Library (#1)**

This is the most practical solution because:
- Proven reliability with thousands of deployments
- Excellent user experience
- No additional hardware or apps required
- Integrates well with existing code structure
- Handles edge cases and error conditions
- Compatible with your current web server architecture

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add WiFiManager library dependency
2. Modify setup() to check for saved credentials
3. If no credentials or connection fails, start configuration portal
4. Integrate with existing Preferences system
5. Add factory reset option (button hold or web endpoint)

**Fallback Option: Custom Web Portal (#2)**
If you want more control over the user experience and are willing to invest more development time.

## Next Steps
1. Review these options
2. Choose preferred approach
3. Plan implementation details
4. Implement solution
5. Test with multiple networks
6. Document user setup process
